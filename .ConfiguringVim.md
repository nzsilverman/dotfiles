# Configuring Vim
This document contains instructions for configuring vim using the provided vimrc file.

A version of vim with python compiled into it must be installed. 
By default, MacOS does not ship with a version of vim that satisfies this requirement.
This can easily be satisfied by installing via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on a Mac.
```
brew install vim
```

Next, open a document in vim and install all the plugins via the command:
```
:PlugInstall
```

### Install Additional Dependencies
```
# Install powerline fonts https://github.com/powerline/fonts
git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git --depth=1
cd fonts
./install.sh
cd ..
rm -rf fonts
```

To enable powerline fonts, you will need to change your terminals font preferences.
On iterm2, you can do that under `preferences > profile > (select configuration) > text`
and then select `Use built in powerline glyphs`.

### Setup YCM Plugin on MacOS
Generally, the [YouCompleteMe plugin documentation](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe#macos) can be followed. 
The steps here are derived from that.

```
brew install cmake python go nodejs
brew install java
sudo ln -sfn $(brew --prefix java)/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk
brew install llvm # Note, llvm must be added to the path. The zshrc file in this repo does that for you
cd ~/.vim/plugged/YouCompleteMe
python3 install.py --system-libclang --all
```
