# Configuring Ubuntu

Some things need to be switched in Ubuntu to make it more intuitive for me.
This document tracks those personal preferences.

* Decrease the key repeat time
* Change some `Keyboard Shortcuts` in settings
  * `Switch applications` should be disabled
  * `Switch windows` should be `Ctrl+Tab`
