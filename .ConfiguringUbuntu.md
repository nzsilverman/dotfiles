# Configuring Ubuntu

Some things need to be switched in Ubuntu to make it more intuitive for me.
This document tracks those personal preferences. This has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04.

Follow these steps in order:
* Generate an ssh key `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`
* Clone the repository this document is in using the instructions in the README.md file.
  This repository is located here: https://github.com/nzsilverman/dotfiles
* Run the setup script `~/.setup_ubuntu.sh`
* Change compiz settings
  - Open CompizConfigSettingsManager and check the `Place Windows` setting
* Turn on the [Alt+Tab Scroll Workaround](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5282/alttab-scroll-workaround/)
* Prevent swap from being used as frequently by adding the following snippet to `/etc/sysctl.conf`
  ```
  # Limit swap getting used for memory intensive apps
  # https://askubuntu.com/a/1460812
  vm.watermark_boost_factor=0
  vm.swappiness = [value]
  ```

# Make Fingerprint Reader and Webcam Work
Depending on the computer, the fingerprint reader and webcam might need additional drivers before they work.
To install them, open `Software & Updates` and select the drivers under `Additonal Drivers`.
