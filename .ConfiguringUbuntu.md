# Configuring Ubuntu

Some things need to be switched in Ubuntu to make it more intuitive for me.
This document tracks those personal preferences. This has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04.

Follow these steps in order:
* Generate an ssh key `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`
* Clone the repository this document is in using the instructions in the README.md file.
  This repository is located here: https://github.com/nzsilverman/dotfiles
* Run the setup script `~/.setup_ubuntu.sh`
* Change compiz settings
  - Open CompizConfigSettingsManager and check the `Place Windows` setting

# Install Powerline Fonts
```
# clone
git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git --depth=1
# install
cd fonts
./install.sh
# clean-up a bit
cd ..
rm -rf fonts

echo 'export PATH="/home/nathan/.local/share/fonts:${PATH}"' >> ~/.zshrc_local
```

# Make Fingerprint Reader and Webcam Work
Depending on the computer, the fingerprint reader and webcam might need additional drivers before they work.
To install them, open `Software & Updates` and select the drivers under `Additonal Drivers`.
