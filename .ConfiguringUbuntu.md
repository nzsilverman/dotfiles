# Configuring Ubuntu

Some things need to be switched in Ubuntu to make it more intuitive for me.
This document tracks those personal preferences. This has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04.

# Change shell defaults
```
# Install Homebrew so that fzf can be installed through it. The deb package is outdated
sudo apt-get update
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install fzf
sudo apt install -y zsh
chsh -s $(which zsh)
# Get the correct theme for zsh
mkdir -p "$HOME/.zsh"
git clone https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure.git "$HOME/.zsh/pure"
```

# Install Some Useful Applications

```
sudo apt-get install \
  vim-gtk3 \
  git \
  gnome-tweaks \
  curl \
  terminator \
  python3.11 \
  python3.11-distutils

# Install pip
# Note, this installs to $HOME/.local which doesn't get on the path
curl -sS https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python3.11
```

# Change Compiz Settings if necessary
If windows are appearing behind the toolbar, install compiz config and adjust the following settings.
```
sudo apt install compizconfig-settings-manager
```

Open CompizConfigSettingsManager and check the `Place Windows` setting.
This should prevent windows from appearing behind the toolbar.

# Change Some Settings
* Navigate to `Accessibility -> Repeat Keys`
  * Decrease the key repeat delay
* Change some `Keyboard Shortcuts` in settings
  * `Switch applications` should be set to `alt+Tab`
    * This is to make it work decent on a laptop. I wish I could map `alt-tab` and `ctrl-tab` to switch windows, but I
      can't do that.
  * `Switch windows` should be `Ctrl+Tab`
    * This is to make it work well with the advantage keyboard. Switch windows is the behavior I most often want
  * `Hide all normal windows` should be disabled

# Adjust Some Tweaks in Gnome Tweaks
* Keyboard & Mouse > Mouse Click Emulation
  * Change emulation method to `Fingers`
  * Additional Layout Options
    * `Caps Lock Behavior` -> `Swap Caps Lock and Esc`

# Run custom setup scripts
```
~/.setup_git_preferences.sh
```

# Install Powerline Fonts
```
# clone
git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git --depth=1
# install
cd fonts
./install.sh
# clean-up a bit
cd ..
rm -rf fonts

echo 'export PATH="/home/nathan/.local/share/fonts:${PATH}"' >> ~/.zshrc_local
```

# Make Fingerprint Reader and Webcam Work
Depending on the computer, the fingerprint reader and webcam might need additional drivers before they work.
To install them, open `Software & Updates` and select the drivers under `Additonal Drivers`.
